# Education Project - Penn Blockchain Hackathon Project

 ## Description

 This is Blockchain at McGill's Penn Blockchain Hackathon project.
 The project consists of minting educational content as immutable ERC-721 tokens for users to access information without the worry of it being taken down. Given current worldwide political contexts, education should be accessible by everyone: it residing on the blockchain solves potential censorship issues.
